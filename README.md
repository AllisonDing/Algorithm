# BFS & DFS Maze Algorithm Problems - PPT Slides  

## Overview  
This repository contains **PowerPoint slides** (`.pptx`) explaining **Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)** for solving maze problems. The slides include **visual explanations, step-by-step walkthroughs, and comparisons** of these two fundamental graph traversal algorithms.  

## Contents  
- **Introduction to Graph Traversal**  
- **BFS Algorithm** – How it explores shortest paths in a maze  
- **DFS Algorithm** – How it traverses deep paths before backtracking  
- **Comparison: BFS vs. DFS** – Performance, complexity, and use cases  
- **Example Problems** – Maze-solving using BFS and DFS  
- **Complexity Analysis** – Time and space complexity breakdown  

## How to Use  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AllisonDing/Algorithm.git
2. Open the PowerPoint slides (.pptx) using **Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, or LibreOffice Impress.**
3. Explore **BFS & DFS concepts with visualizations** and **step-by-step explanations.**
4. Use the slides for **learning, teaching, or presentations**.
